## BEYOND SALIENCY: ENHANCING EXPLANATION OF SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION WITH EXPERT-REFERENCED ACOUSTIC CUES

Current saliency-based methods, adapted from vision, highlight spectrogram regions but fail to show whether these regions correspond to meaningful acoustic markers of emotion, limiting faithfulness and interpretability. We propose a framework that overcomes these limitations by quantifying the magnitudes of cues within salient regions. This clarifies “what” is highlighted and connects it to “why” it matters, linking saliency to expert-referenced acoustic cues of speech emotions.
